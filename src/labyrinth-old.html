            <p>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
            development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
            efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
            open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
            with others.</p>
            
            <p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and

            redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
            names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
            however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
            requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
            to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>

            <h2>Canada Type Desktop Fonts Agreement<h2>
            <p>We have tried our best to make our licensing terms very clear and reasonable, but if you have any questions about any of them, you can always contact us using the information in section F below, and we promise to do our best to clarify things further for you. If you do not like the terms of this agreement, please contact us with any suggestions you may have for improving it. We want to satisfy our customers to the best of our ability, and we want our fonts to fit in your workflow the way you want them to.</p>
            <p>By installing any Canada Type fonts on a computer you or your company owns, you are indicating that you agree that the fonts being installed are the exclusive property of Canada Type, and you or your company have a license of that property under the following terms and conditions:<br></p> 
            <h3>A) NUMBER OF MACHINES:</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
            <li>A1 - You can install the font(s) on one computer used in conjunction with one physical output device. </li>
            <li>A2 - The physical output device mentioned in item A1 can be an inkjet printer, laser printer, offset press, silkscreener, vinyl cutter, or die-maker (for rubber stamps, as an example). If you have any other physical output devices you think may qualify under this clause, please let us know and we can help you determine whether or not it does. </li>
            <li>A3 - If you want to license Canada Type fonts for more than one computer or one output device, you must upgrade your license to a multiple-device one. A multiple-device license includes the exact same terms as a standard license, but with a higher number of devices allowed. Multiple-device licenses come with automatic discounts, based on the number of devices you want the license to cover.<br></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>B) WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH CANADA TYPE FONTS:</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
            <li>B1 - You can use Canada Type fonts with any software that supports them. This includes mainstream retail software such as Microsoft, Adobe, Macromedia, Apple, Corel or any other software retailer’s programs, or proprietary software you or your company may have had custom-made for special tasks.</li>
            <li>B2 - You can use Canada Type fonts to print as many copies of anything as you like, with no limits on number of impressions or print size. Supermassive national and international marketing campaigns are OK. So are million unit print runs. So are enormous chain-store signs. We love that stuff. It gives our fonts exposure!</li>
            <li>B3 - You can send Canada Type fonts to your service/prepress bureau if the job requires it, but please make sure the fonts are deleted from there once the job is done. If your service bureau doesn't delete the fonts, they will probably end up being used for a job other than yours, which reduces the value of the fonts you bought and keeps us from being compensated for our work.</li> 
            <li>B4 - You can embed Canada Type fonts in electronic documents. This includes PDF, Flash and Microsoft Office documents (such as Word or Powerpoint), or multimedia files, but please make sure, if at all possible, that you do not embed the complete character set. Fonts embedded in electronic documents can usually be extracted and pirated, so the less characters are embedded in a document, the less functionally desirable and piratable the font extract becomes.</li> 
            <li>B5 - You can use Canada Type fonts for anything web-related, except making them available to others for download, or making them available for others to use as part of an interface for a web server-based program. If you want to make Canada Type fonts available as part of a dynamic interface for a server-based program (such as a Flash or PHP/Javascript program) you must contact Canada Type at info@canadatype.com or by phone at 416-806-1362 for a special license.</li> 
            <li>B6 - You can use Canada Type fonts to print artwork on clothes, cars, mugs, fridge magnets or any other products that you, your company, or your clients are selling.</li> 
            <li>B7 - You can use Canada Type fonts to make non-digital 3-dimensional shapes, rubber stamps or scrapbooking alphabets that you can sell, but we have a condition if you want to do that: you must label your stamps or scrapbooking alphabets with the same name Canada Type uses for the font, and you must credit us with its design.For example: if you like to produce a complete rubber stamp alphabet using our Press Gothic font, the name of your rubber stamp alphabet has to be Adore, and somewhere on the packaging of the stamps, or on the web site retailing the stamps, you must state that the alphabet was produced using Canada Type's Press Gothic font.</li> 
            <li>B8 - You can use Canada Type fonts to produce any artwork meant to be part of a corporate identity or branding. This includes logos, slogans, letterheads, business cards, business forms, banners, film titling, tie-in products, etc.</li> 
            <li>B9 - You can transfer this license to another user for a fee that doesn't exceed the original amount you paid for the license, but you have to inform us of this transfer either by email or by phone, so that we can update our customer support records. If you do transfer this license to another user, you must delete the fonts from all the previously licensed computers.</li> 
            <li>B10 - You can keep one backup copy of any Canada Type fonts you have licensed, but the backup medium you use should be secure and only privately accessible.</li> 
            <li>B11 - You can modify Canada Type fonts to your hearts content, but only for uses outlined within the condition of this license, and as long as the modifications are being done by yourself or Canada Type.. Modification also means font format conversion. If you have a Mac and a PC, you can use conversion software (like CrossFont or TransType) to convert the font between platforms. Please make sure to read items C3 and D2 for other conditions on font modification. For example: if you decide that our font Press Gothic can be great for your logo, but you need a differently shaped B for it, you can modify the B of the Press Gothic font you licensed, and use your new B for the logo.</li>
            <li>B12 - If you are wondering about a particular type of usage we forgot to include in this agreement, just drop us a line or give us a call and we will put your mind at ease.<br></li> 
            </ul>
            <h3>C) WHAT YOU CANNOT DO WITH CANADA TYPE FONTS:</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
            <li>C1 - You cannot give away copies of Canada Type fonts in ways that do not comply with the rest of this agreement. For example: you cannot make any Canada Type fonts available for download on the internet, email them to your friends, upload them to public internet file transfer or storing channels. Please respect the value of our work, so that we keep having an incentive to continue doing it.</li> 
            <li>C2 - You cannot resell Canada Type fonts through any medium unless you have written authorization from us to be a Canada Type distributor. This also means you cannot modify Canada Type fonts then sell the resulting modification.</li> 
            <li>C3 - As relates to item B11, font modification is allowed, but must be done by either Canada Type or the font’s licensee (that’s you or your company or an employee of your company - but not an outside contractor or the creative department of an affiliate company). Third parties to this license are not allowed to modify Canada Type fonts under any circumstance, unless formally authorized in writing by Canada Type.<br></li>
            </ul> 
            <h3>D) SUPPORT AND VERSION UPGRADES:</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
            <li>D1 - All Canada Type fonts undergo thorough testing before they are available for licensing, but if we did something wrong and the font you licensed doesn't perform up to your expectations, we will replace it with a satisfactory copy. Please make sure you include the order number or have the purchase receipt available when you ask for an exchange.</li> 
            <li>D2 - All Canada Type fonts come with free lifetime support. This is true of any and all Canada Type fonts, but not of customer-modified fonts (including converted or regenerated fonts), unless the modifications were made by Canada Type. We cannot really support a font unless we know exactly how it came to be the way it is. The production and/or modification of our fonts within Canada Type’s own software and hardware environments is documented and archievd, so we can trust ourselves to be able to troubleshoot fonts made directly by Canada Type, but we cannot vouch for any third party font conversion or editing software or hardware.</li> 
            <li>D3 - All Canada Type fonts come with free lifetime version upgrades. For example: if you license a font from us, and a year later we upgrade that font, you get the new upgrade for free. If five years later we upgrade the font even further, you get the further upgrade for free as well. We promise to keep providing free version upgrades for as long as Canada Type exists under its current ownership and management, which we project and hope to be a long, long time from now.</li>
            </ul> 
            <h3>E) MISCELLANEOUS NOTES:</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
            <li>E1 - If you use our fonts in a film or publication, and you generously decide that you have room for creative credits, please credit the fonts to Canada Type, just like you credit the photos to their photographers and illustrations to their illustrators. A font is at least as much of a creative work as a photograph or an illustration, so it deserves its own credit where creative credits are given.</li>
            <li>E2 - If you don't agree with some of our license terms, please discuss the issue with us. We are always open to new ways of providing our customers with better service. We are a small independent font development studio that thrives only by keeping our customers happy enough to come back for more. We believe that fonts with unreasonable restrictions do not ultimately contribute to anyone’s satisfaction, so we try our best to keep our licensing adaptable to as many workflows as possible.</li> 
            <li>E3 - Our fonts are made to be used as fonts are normally used. We can guarantee and support their functionality as fonts, but not as anything else. We cannot take responsibility for incidental damages arising from our fonts being used in any application or in a certain way. Also we cannot take responsibility for a user’s level of experience in using fonts within certain workflows. For example: if you license one of our fonts, and one of your employees does not know how to use it, we cannot be held responsible for lost time or an angry client.</li>
            </ul>
