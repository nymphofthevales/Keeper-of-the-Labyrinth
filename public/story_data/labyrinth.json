Its skin is not smooth like polished stone nor yielding like flesh, but solid, and rough, as if carved with unskilled hands, a facsimile of a face only, a dancer barefoot in the sand, struggling for footing, and the crowd of strangers gathering about her, the ever-shifting faces dancing faster than her feet ever could, the twirling winds brought about not by the waving of her arms, but by the turning of the crowd, and as I push my fingers into the eye sockets and lift the mask off the wall I am driven by fey desire to see her through the eyes of the mass, to know the dancer by the iris of a stranger.","options":[{"text":"Next","destination":"Waiting3"}]},"Waiting3":{"content":"The mask is heavy upon my face but shapes neatly to the curve of my brow, the form of my nose.

How could we imagine a person that is not there, superimposed on her flesh? We do because it is all we can do, as we wait, wait patiently for her to emerge.

One slopes gently downwards, and looking down it I feel a deep thrumming noise reverberating from it.

Such a journey does not happen overnight—I know I shall meet them again—but now I am prepared. Knowing them and myself is the only weapon I can have going forward, and it's one I'm glad to have gained, even if it cost the loss of my other tools.

I wove that cloak myself—weaving was one of the first things my teacher taught me—and embroidered the symbol of the Keeper onto the collar just for this journey.

Without it I feel somewhat bare.","options":[{"text":"Next","destination":"tools1"}]},"tools1":{"content":"My tools are a similar matter—the wand I carved myself when I was first learning direction and control of magic. The act of carving itself, creating the forms one desires from an unformed block of wood, was far more vital than any of the spells I was so eager to cast with it—though I didn't realize this at the time. True magic has a way of being more physical, more literal, than many people expect. I can make another. Perhaps it is time to do so, in any case.","options":[{"text":"Next","destination":"tools2"}]},"tools2":{"content":"The runes I inherited from my teacher, which I believe she came to own in the same way, by her teacher before her. They say the more generations a divining tool has passed through, the more accurate it becomes, guided by the wisdom of the ancestors through whose hands it has passed.

The important thing is not the tool itself but the link it represents.","options":[{"text":"Next","destination":"tools3"}]},"tools3":{"content":"I'm glad I still have my knife, which my brother, an apprentice under the town smith, made for me.
