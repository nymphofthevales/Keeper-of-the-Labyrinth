<p>A text-based narrative game. Runs on a custom data structure for rendering linked nodes with text and options. Includes an image gallery, a basic audio system, file I/O for game saves, and a tile-based map of the branching node structure for rendering save file paths.</p>

<p>Currently working on porting the game structure over to Electron + Svelte + Typescript.</p>
