 </p>
<p>A text-based narrative game. Runs on a custom data structure for rendering linked nodes with text and options. Includes an image gallery, a basic audio system, file I/O for game saves, and a tile-based map of the branching node structure for rendering save file paths.</p>

<p>In future, I hope to package the code for this custom data structure and renderer as a library for making choose-your-own-adventure style games in Javascript and HTML.</p>

<p>Currently in development. Everything published in this repository is ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. By all means, feel free to fork the repo to poke around at my code, but keep it to personal use only, and please do not redistribute the game assets, writing, etc. Thanks!</p>

If you fork the repo, you can run the game with a simple ```npm start```. You will need a local or global install on the latest versions of npm and electron-forge for this to work. However, please note that the game is unfinished, lacking some functionalities, full of bugs, and I really don't reccomend *playing* it in its present state. If you wanna play it, get it on Steam when it's done :)
