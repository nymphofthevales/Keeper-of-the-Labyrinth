A narrative text-based game. Runs on a custom data structure for rendering linked nodes with text and options. 

Includes an image gallery, a basic audio system, file I/O for game saves, and a tile-based map of the branching node structure for rendering save file paths.

In future, I hope to package the code for this custom data structure and renderer as a library for making choose-your-own-adventure style games in Javascript and HTML.
